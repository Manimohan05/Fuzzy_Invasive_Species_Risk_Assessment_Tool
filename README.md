## 📋 Overview

This dashboard implements scientifically validated fuzzy logic assessment models for evaluating the invasiveness risk of alien plant species. The tool combines:

- **Biological measurements** (quantitative plant traits)
- **Expert knowledge** (qualitative assessments)
- **Fuzzy logic** (to handle uncertainty and imprecision in ecological data)

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Modern User Interface
- **Professional Design** - Bluish theme with gradient accents
- **Dark Mode Support** - Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Responsive Layout** - Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Interactive Components** - Smooth animations and intuitive controls

### 🔬 Assessment Models

**Model I — LOWA (Equal Weights)**
- Equal weighting for all main risk factors
- Good for baseline assessments
- Simple and balanced approach

**Model II — LWA (Expert Weights)** ⭐ Recommended
- Expert-weighted factors based on scientific evidence
- **Weight Distribution:**
  - Dispersal: 40%
  - Vegetative Reproduction Strength (VRS): 40%
  - Seed Germination Requirement (SGR): 15%
  - Man-made/Natural Disturbance (MIS): 5%
- Highest agreement with real-world data

### 📊 Assessment Factors

#### Dispersal Factors (Quantitative)
Measure how effectively seeds spread:
- **SF** — Seeds per fruit
- **ASR** — Annual seed production per m²
- **VIA** — Seed viability (months)
- **LDD** — Long-distance dispersal potential (0-10 scale)

#### Main Risk Factors (Linguistic)
Assess reproductive capability and human influence:
- **VRS** — Vegetative reproduction strength
- **SGR** — Seed germination requirement level
- **HA** — Human activity influence on spreading
- **NMD** — Natural/man-made disturbance influence

### 🎯 Risk Level Classification

| Risk Level | Description |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **Unlikely** | Extremely low invasiveness potential |
| 🟢 **Very Low** | Very unlikely to become invasive |
| 🔵 **Low** | Low probability of invasion |
| 🟡 **Medium** | Moderate invasiveness risk — monitor closely |
| 🟠 **High** | High invasiveness risk — management recommended |
| 🔴 **Very High** | Very high invasiveness risk — urgent action needed |
| 🔴 **Extremely High** | Critical invasiveness risk — immediate intervention required |
